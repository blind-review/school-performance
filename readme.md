# What does student performance tell us about school effectiveness?

Assessing teacher and school performance has become increasingly prevelent in many education systems. But directly measuring the causal impact of a school or pedagogy on student academic ability is difficult. Instead, student performance is used as a proxy for school performance.

But what exactly can we infer about school performance from student performance? A computer simulation can provide some insight.

Two schools are populated with a random allocation of students of differing ability. High academic ability students are blue, low ability students are red.  Neither school has any causal impact on a student's academic impact. Instead, at the end of each year, students choose which school they wish to attend based on their perception of school performance. 

We make the following assumptions:

  - School performance is measured by student performance.
  - Students don't know schools have no causal impact.
  - Students want to go to the highest performing school.

And some further assumptions to be trialed:

  - Schools are selective in admission
  - Higher ability students have greater capacity to move school
  - Some schools start with different distributions of student performance.

My hypothesis is that desipite both schools having no causal impact on student performance, the combination of a proxy measure, student choice, and selective mechanisms will result in very different relative performance.

In short, we can infer very little about school performance from student results.
