	  <h1>What does student performance <br />tell us about school effectiveness?</h1>

    <p>Assessing teacher and school performance has become increasingly prevelent in many education systems.  But directly measuring the causal impact of a school or pedagogy on student academic ability is difficult.  Instead, student performance is used as a proxy for school performance.</p>

    <p>But what exactly can we infer about school performance from student performance?  A computer simulation can provide some insight.</p>

    <p>Two schools are populated with a random allocation of students of differing ability.  High academic ability students are blue, low ability students are red.</p>

    <p>Neither school has any causal impact on a student's academic ability.  Instead, at the end of each year, students choose which school they wish to attend based on their perception of school performance.  We make the following assumptions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>School performance is measured by student performance.</li>
      <li>Students don't know schools have no causal impact.</li>
      <li>Students want to go to the highest performing school.</li>
      <li>Schools are selective where possible.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My hypothesis is that desipite both schools having no causal impact on student performance, the combination of a proxy measure, student choice, and selective mechanisms will result in very different relative performance.</p>

    <p>In short, we can infer very little about school performance from student results.</p>

    <p>Right now, this is a proof of concept as the full range of assumptions are yet to be modelled.</p>
